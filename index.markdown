Welcome to my site! I'm Isabella Goss - an early-career technical writer with two years of software documentation experience.

I graduated in 2021 from North Carolina State University with a major in Graphics Communications and two minors: one in Technical and Scientific Communications and another in Science Communication. I'm the Swiss Army Knife of technical communicators: I can write succinct technical documentation, create crisp, well-defined technical drawings, and can build documentation sites (like this one)!

In my free time, I enjoy baking, embroidery, and reading a good book!

You can reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gossisabella/) and by [email](mailto:forstisabella@gmail.com).
