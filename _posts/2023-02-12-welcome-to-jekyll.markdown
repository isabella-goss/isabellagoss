Hi! I'm Isabella Goss, a technical writer based in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, USA. 

I fell in love with reading at a young age, and in my early teens, graudated from YA fiction and easy readers to my mom's IT textbooks. In the pages of those textbooks I fell in love with technical writing, although I didn't know it yet! After a brief (failed) stint as  a civil engineering student in NC State University's College of Engineering, I transferred to the Technology, Engineering, and Design Education department at NC State, where I combined my love of written technical communication with visual communication. I eventually graudated with a B.S. in Graphics Communications, but not before I spent my summers freeelancing as a web content writer and journalist! 

Today, I work as a technical writer at [Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/), where I document Segment's ingestion, processing, and governance features.

Follow along my technical writing journey!
